\arguments{
\item{object}{a \code{SlingshotDataSet} object.}

\item{x}{a \code{SlingshotDataSet} object.}

matrix and cluster labels.}

dimensional matrix.}
}
\value{
The accessor functions \code{reducedDim}, \code{clusterLabels}, 
  \code{lineages}, \code{adjacency}, \code{curves},
  and \code{slingParams} return the corresponding elements of a 
  \code{SlingshotDataSet}. The functions \code{pseudotime} and 
  \code{curveWeights} extract useful output elements of a 
  \code{SlingshotDataSet}, provided that curves have already been fit with 
  either \code{slingshot} or \code{getCurves}.

A matrix of cluster weights for each cell or a vector of cluster
  assignments.
}
\description{
The \code{SlingshotDataSet} class holds data relevant for 
  performing lineage inference with the \code{slingshot} package, primarily a
  reduced dimensional representation of the data and a set of cluster labels.
  All \code{slingshot} methods can take an object of the class 
  \code{SlingshotDataSet} as input and will output the same.

Extract cluster labels, either a character vector or matrix of 
  weights.

\details{
Warning: this will remove any existing lineages or curves from the 
\code{SlingshotDataSet} object.

\section{Methods (by generic)}{
\itemize{

object.

\item \code{reducedDim}: returns the matrix representing the reduced
dimensional dataset.

\item \code{reducedDims}: returns the matrix representing the reduced
dimensional dataset.

\item \code{clusterLabels}: extracts cluster labels from a
\code{SlingshotDataSet} object.

\item \code{[}: Subset dataset and cluster labels.
}}

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{reducedDim}}{matrix. An \code{n} by \code{p} numeric matrix or data frame
giving the coordinates of the cells in a reduced dimensionality space.}

\item{\code{clusterLabels}}{matrix or character. An \code{n} by \code{K} matrix of 
weights indicating each cell's cluster assignment or a character vector of
cluster assignments, which will be converted into a binary matrix.}

\item{\code{lineages}}{list. A list with each element a character vector of cluster 
names representing a lineage as an ordered set of clusters.}

\item{\code{adjacency}}{matrix. A binary matrix describing the adjacency 
between clusters induced by the minimum spanning tree.}

\item{\code{curves}}{list. A list of \code{\link[princurve]{principal_curve}} objects
produced by \code{\link{getCurves}}.}

\item{\code{slingParams}}{list. Additional parameters used by Slingshot. These may 
specify how the minimum spanning tree on clusters was constructed: 
\itemize{ 
\item{\code{start.clus}}{character. The label of the root cluster.} 
\item{\code{end.clus}}{character. Vector of cluster labels indicating the 
terminal clusters.}
\item{\code{start.given}}{logical. A logical value 
indicating whether the initial state was pre-specified.} 
\item{\code{end.given}}{logical. A vector of logical values indicating 
whether each terminal state was pre-specified}
\item{\code{dist}}{matrix. A
numeric matrix of pairwise cluster distances.} }
They may also specify how simultaneous principal curves were constructed:
\itemize{ 
\item{\code{shrink}}{logical or numeric between 0 and 1. Determines whether
and how much to shrink branching lineages toward their shared average 
curve.} 
\item{\code{extend}}{character. Specifies the method for handling 
root and leaf clusters of lineages when constructing the initial, 
piece-wise linear curve. Accepted values are 'y' (default), 'n', and 'pc1'.
See \code{\link{getCurves}} for details.} 
\item{\code{reweight}}{logical. 
Indicates whether to allow cells shared
between lineages to be reweighted during curve-fitting. If \code{TRUE},
cells shared between lineages will be iteratively reweighted based on the
quantiles of their projection distances to each curve.} 
\item{\code{reassign}}{logical. 
Indicates whether to reassign cells to lineages at each
iteration. If \code{TRUE}, cells will be added to a lineage when their
projection distance to the curve is less than the median distance for all
cells currently assigned to the lineage. Additionally, shared cells will be
removed from a lineage if their projection distance to the curve is above
the 90th percentile and their weight along the curve is less than
\code{0.1}.} 
\item{\code{shrink.method}}{character. 
Denotes how to determine the amount of shrinkage for a branching lineage. 
Accepted values are the same as for \code{kernel} in  the \code{density} 
function (default is \code{"cosine"}), as well as \code{"tricube"} and 
\code{"density"}. See \code{\link{getCurves}} for details.}
\item{Other parameters specified by 
\code{\link[princurve]{principal_curve}}}. }}
