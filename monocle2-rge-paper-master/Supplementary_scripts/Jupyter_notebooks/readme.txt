Please note that this folder includes:
1. the Jupyter notebook for reproducing the complex tree for the Fig 16 (relevant code are taken from revision_1_running_time.R, the correct file, previously submitted with Monocle 2 manuscript)
2. PDF and html files saved from the the notebook (can be visualized if your environment doesnâ€™t include the Jupyter notebook) 
3. the cds (cell dataset object) for the Paul dataset 

Note that you need to install the Monocle 2, DDRTree and xacHelpe packages we previously submitted along with Monocle 2 manuscript in order to run the jupyter notebook. 

In addition, we are in the process of overhauling our Monocle 2 website and more extensive tutorial, including the Paul dataset, will be added in. 

Hope those helps, thanks!
